This is a single-page application I made for my coding bootcamp, Flatiron. It is a Dungeons and Dragons character creator, which fetches JSON data from the DnD 5th Edition API to assist the user in the character creation process, and help dungeon masters manage the stats for all the characters in their campaign.

In order to use this app, you must run json server on db.json.

$ json-server --watch db.json

Then just open index.html or use my link below for the project page, click New Character then you're good to create your character.

Once a character is created, the data gets saved into your database and a card will be appended to the character screen. The user may delete any character, an edit button will be implemented in the future.
