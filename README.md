Dungeons and Dragons - Character Creator

Hello! This is my first project in phase 1 of the software engineering course at Flatiron School flex program.

The goal for this project is to create a single page web application which fetches data from a public API. The criterias which must be met includes 3 unique event listeners, at least one instance of array iteration using available Javascript methods (map, forEach, or filter), and using json-server to persist the applications interactivity.

HOW TO USE:
Upon opening the application, the user is met with a start page which will eventually show all characters created.
Clicking "New Character" will display the create character container.
